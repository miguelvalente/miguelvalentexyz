 Hi, my name is Miguel and I have over 10k hours surfing the web so I guess I consider myself an expert at staring at screens while life withers away. Pic related. I won't bore you with any dramatic monologues about my love-hate relationship with technology. Let's just say it's complicated, like a dysfunctional rom-com.

On a more serious note, I'm passionate about refining my skills and diving into uncharted territories. My fascination with AI has driven me over the past four years, as I see it as a beacon of hope in finding solutions to the myriad problems we face. That's all about me for now. If you'd like to connect and exchange ideas, don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto://miguelvalente@pm.me); my inbox is open.
