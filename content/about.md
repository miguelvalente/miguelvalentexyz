 Hi, my name is Miguel and I have over 10k hours surfing the web so I guess I consider myself an expert at staring at screens while life withers away. Pic related. I won't bore you with any dramatic monologues about my love-hate relationship with technology. Let's just say it's complicated.

On a more serious note, I'm passionate about refining my skills and diving into uncharted territories. My growing interest in AI has kept me buzy for the past four years, as I see it as a promissing way to tackle the endless problems life throws our way. That's all about me for now. If you'd like to connect and exchange ideas, don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto://miguelvalente@pm.me); my inbox is open.
