 Hi, my name is Miguel and I have over 10k hours surfing the web so I guess I consider myself an expert at staring at screens while life withers away. Pic related. I have a love/hate relationship with technology, some sort of Stockholm syndrome where I'm both the kidnapper and the kidnapee. I love how much I hate it and I hate how much I love it. Malaise giving technology, freedom of expression giving technology.

_Jokes_ aside, I strive to make whatever it is I spend time on better. Over the last 4 years I've been on an AI trip, my [resume](resume) backs me up. It's probably the only way out of this hole we keep digging. That's all I have to say _about_ me for now. Anyways, feel free to [reach out](mailto://miguelvalente@pm.me), my Inbox is open.
