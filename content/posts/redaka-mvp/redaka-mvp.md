Five months ago, I ditched what I thought was my dream job. I was a deep learning developer, messing with models, training them, changing them, doing research, and applying findings. But I left it for, well, let's just say reasons ðŸ¥¸. Fast-forward to May 2023, and I just about finished an MVP in the span of two weeks for an automatic image-text translation WebApp as my first paid freelance gig. Imagine Google Lens, with an editing suite. In the end the client was thrilled and requested that I continue refining the product for public release as a paid service. What follows is all about those two weeks, what freelancing felt like, the technologies used, mistakes made, and lessons learned and how they reminded me that there's more to life than just deep learning. And honestly, it's been a while since I've felt this excited about my work.

 _Disclaimer : If you didn't notice I'll say it for you -- I may a hardened freelancing veteran. So take my words with a jumbo sized bucket of salt. Specialy if you see this cute little fella_ "ðŸ¤·".

# Bugaroo-Switcheroo you're smelly too:

My role shifted constantly. Like alot, for realsies. One moment, I'm managing the project, looking at timelines and resources, the next, I'm immersed in backend development, refining code, writing tests and getting the damned CI to pass, look at the clock and chill for five minutes before I find myself talking with the client, coming up with solutions on the spot and nudging him in a direction that makes sence for developing, to immediately start drafting a UI that requires that makes sence and is minimal effort for the frontend developer I subcontracted and coordinate with. Breath, the sentence is over. That's how I felt after calling it a long-day.

Still the freedom compensated for the switchero, unlike some Carl Newport shills migth say ðŸ™ƒ.
