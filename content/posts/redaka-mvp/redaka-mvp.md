Five months ago, I ditched what I thought was my dream job. I was a deep learning developer, messing with models, training them, changing them, doing research, and uncovering/applying findings. But I left it for, well, let's just say reasons. Fast-forward to May 2023, and I just about finished an MVP in two weeks for an automatic image-text translation app as my first paid freelance project. Picture Google Lens, with an editing suite. The client is thrilled and wants me to keep working on it, aiming to release it as a paid service for the public. This post is all about those two weeks, the technologies used, mistakes made, and lessons learned and how they reminded me that there's more to life than just deep learning. Honestly, it's been a while since I've felt this excited about my work.
