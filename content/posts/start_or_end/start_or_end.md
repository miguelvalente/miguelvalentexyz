[Starting](Starting) something is easy, seeing it through is a different type of beast and a quick look at the ruins of my __deving__ folder comfirms it. But with time I got better at sticking to  my ideas and projects. It took a while, took some training. It always takes a bit longer than what I think. Having that said I'll revive one idea that didn't take off.

Exactly two years ago I decided to start a _blog-thing_. I don't like the word __blog__. This was my first post out of three over a couple of years.

I guess a lot as changed since then, but, not really.
