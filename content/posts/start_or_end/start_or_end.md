Starting something is easy, seeing it through is a different type of beast, a quick look at the ruins of my __deving__ folder cements the though. But with time I've started to get better at persevering with ideas/projects. But It took a while, took some training. It always takes a bit longer with me, my threshold to change paths is quite high I guess.

On the topic of not seing things through I'll revive another idea that didn't take off. Exactly two years ago I decided to start a _blog-thing_. This was my first post out of three over the couple of years.

I guess a lot as changed since then, but not, really.
