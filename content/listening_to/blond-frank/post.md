2016, summer’s waving goodbye. Still hot, dusty. I share a bud with the person sitting next to me; Blond is on. We don't really talk, but we know. Blond becomes the catalyst that changed the next few years of our lives.

One of my favorite albums of all time. I can't point to a song and say that it doesn't work. Just too good, and I was lucky enough for it to hit, to click, to strike me through and through.
