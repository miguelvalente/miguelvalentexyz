Still half-deaf from a week-long, painful, and annoying ear infection, and with summer ramping up, I needed a break. And boy oh boy, I didn't need to look any further.

This album ticks off the following
- [x] Breaks
- [x] More breaks?

Just waiting for the moment when my ear decides to clear up ðŸ« , so I can fully enjoy these poppy, reverberating, hectic bangers.
