I write for a reason, not for no reason. I wrote this for you for a reason. Not for no reason. If you're reading this. Read carefully. There's a reason. Not no reason. The reason exists and I must. Why don't you. Listen. There's a reason. Always a reason. Your fear. Your mothers stubbornness. No. See. You must. Please see and. Don't say much. The reason is... I'm not the one to shy away and moan and though I am a deeply flawed human I felt the shame, when you layed your eyes on me with pain. It hurts. I always cared.
 I'm sorry I looked away.
