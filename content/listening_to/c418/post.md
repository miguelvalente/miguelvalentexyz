In the highest flattest step. Among breeze. In the middle of the night. Surrounded by spiders and skeletons. Afraid, looking for a torch. I hadn't slept. Chased. Running, evading and jumping. When I used to not care at all. Simpler. Way, lost too. The way here. Where too I care. For when I used to not care at all, lost in all, looking for the way home where healing could begin, I listened to a lullaby.

In the highest flattest step. Among breeze. In the middle of the night. Surrounded by spiders and skeletons. Looking for a torch. For home. Afraid. I hadn't slept yet. Soon to snooze to forget. Chased. Running and evading and jumping. When I used to not care. Simpler. Way, lost too. The way here. When I used to not care at all. Looking for the way home where healing would begin.This are just four words. and some more this ist.
