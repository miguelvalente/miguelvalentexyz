{{< lyrics >}}
Right Now
.
No cap and gown, I ain't go to class (Uh, yeah)
I'd rather die before I come in last 
...

No Time
.
We ain't got time
I drop my demons off, clear my mind
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch, she a dime (Hold up)
All these niggas, they cap 'round here, they stay lyin' (Hold up)
We ain't got time
I drop my demons off (Yeah), clear my mind
Ridin' 'round town with a bad ass bitch (Yeah), she a dime (Hold up)
All these niggas, they cap 'round here (Yeah), they stay lyin' (Hold up)
...
