 Past, present. Digitized. Nothing lived just once. Afraid of not losing.
 Cause maybe you're a bit fe-fe-fearful. Of not living, fear full of not
 appreciating. Never forgetting. An ever expanding library. upheld.
 Uniformity, duly deserved. Hold on for as long as I can. To me. As
 I want. My childish. Future, propensities. All of life, all of it on your
 hands. Why not. Everything you do its been done before and everything you
 say you said that yesterday.
