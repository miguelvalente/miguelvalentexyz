While on a high I want to digitize my past. all of it. Every moment, never lived just once. the power relive, life. No more dragons. Squeeze it till nothing. Afraid of the lost of what should be forever gone. Uniqueness. Unjustifiably Upheld. Cause maybe you're a bit fe-fe-fearful. Uniformity, duly deserving. Hold on for as long as I can as I want. My childish. Future, propensities. All of life, all of it on your hands. Why not.
