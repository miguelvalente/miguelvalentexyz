Eerie soundscapes, salt & peppered voices echoing, reverberating repetition, rain, wind, and a sublime plunge into dystopian realms reminiscent of Blade Runner â€“ I'm a sucker for this aesthetic.

> For a similar atmosphere, explore [Vangelis - Blade Runner](https://www.discogs.com/master/12717-Vangelis-Blade-Runner) album; if pressed for time, at least give _Memories of Green_ a listen. 

I stumbled upon this album in the most fitting setting: a WEB 1.0 [time capsule](http://music.hyperreal.org/epsilon/info/2001_classic_ambient.html) showcasing classic ambient albums. Like the album itself, the unadorned HTML satisfies the craving for simplicity amid a cluttered world.
