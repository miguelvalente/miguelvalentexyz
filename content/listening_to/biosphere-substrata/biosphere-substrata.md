Ghostly soundscapes, echoey salt&peppered voices, reverbs, repetition, rain, wind, and ethereal immersion in dystopian worlds akin to Blade Runner; I'm a sucker for this aesthetic.
> for similar vibes listen to [Vangelis - Blade Runner](https://www.discogs.com/master/12717-Vangelis-Blade-Runner) entire album, but if you're in a rush, at least try out  _Memories of Green_.

I found this album in the most fitting place, a WEB 1.0 capsule [rank of classic ambient albums](http://music.hyperreal.org/epsilon/info/2001_classic_ambient.html). Like the album, the raw HTML fulfills the yearning for simplicity in a bloated world.
