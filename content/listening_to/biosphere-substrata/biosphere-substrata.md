Listen to this one you like albums that transport you to dystopian worlds
of glitches, reverbs and ethereal immersion. I'm listening to 2017 re-issue wich contains a seconds CD full of yummi tracks. It reminds me of [Vangelis - Blade Runner](https://www.discogs.com/master/12717-Vangelis-Blade-Runner) soundtrack. I found this album in the most fitting of places, a [Web 1.0](http://music.hyperreal.org/epsilon/info/2001_classic_ambient.html) . It ranked number 1.
